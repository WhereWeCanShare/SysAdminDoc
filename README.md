# SysAdminDoc

System Document is in [Wiki](https://github.com/WhereWeCanShare/SysAdminDoc/wiki)

Initially, would like to have all my Linux system admin writing here but checking on some of my bash script gist and found some outdated. Better push the updated ones here as well. It will slowly push a bash script as it requires to revise first for more generic use or less edit.
