# SysAdminDoc

System Document is in [Wiki](https://github.com/WhereWeCanShare/SysAdminDoc/wiki)

Initially, would like to have all my Linux system admin written here but checking on some of my [bash script gist](https://gist.github.com/wannadrunk) and found some outdated. Better push the updated ones here as well. It will slowly push a bash script as it requires to revise first for more generic use or less edit.

## scripts

- [chkport.sh](scripts/chkport.sh) for checking the service network port, it requires `nc` which may not be available on some Linux distro. [Search for one](https://duckduckgo.com/?q=linux+nc+ncat) that is replacement.

- [dbbak.sh](scripts/dbbak.sh) script to do the Postgresql DBs dump and compress.

- [chkdskspace.sh](scripts/chkdskspace.sh) provide the disk space info.

## disclaimer

Use it on your own risk. All bash scripts run well on my Debian/Rasbain 10 buster.
